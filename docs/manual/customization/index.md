# Customizing DAMAP

You can customize the appearance of the DAMAP installation in several ways.

## Available customizations

- [Logos](logos.md)
- [Colors](colors.md)
- [Texts](texts.md)

## Recompiling the frontend

Please note that many customizations require you to rebuild the [frontend code](https://github.com/damap-org/damap-frontend) from source. The easiest way to do this is to use the included [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/damap-org/damap-frontend/blob/next/Dockerfile) to build a container image.
