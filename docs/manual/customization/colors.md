# Customizing colors

DAMAP provides a built-in theme customization interface that allows administrators to customize colors at runtime through the Admin Page → Theme Page.

## Background Information

The [Material Design System](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/how-the-system-works) is implemented under the hood to generate the entire color palette from just a few input colors.

For example, choosing green: ![Green Color Palette](../colors-media/algorithm.png)

## Page Structure

The page is divided into two parts: **Color Pickers** and **Color Previews**:

![Page Structure](../colors-media/page.png)

Clicking on a color picker allows you to input your institution's color:

<div style="display: flex;">
    <img src="../colors-media/input.png" style="width: 30%">
    <p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; width: 5%">
        or
    </p>
    <img src="../colors-media/input2.png" style="width: 30%">
    <p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; width: 5%">
        or
    </p>
    <img src="../colors-media/input3.png" style="width: 30%">
</div>

_Color picker depends on your browser, yours might look different. Most of them also have a button to toggle the Color Code type (RGB vs HEX vs CYMK)_

## Example Flow

Let's customize the page for TU Wien. The primary color of TU Wien is `#006699`, so if you input that into the **Primary Color Picker** you get this:

![TU Wien Theme](../colors-media/tuwien1.png)

At this point, you might notice that the colors throughout the application do not 100% match the Primary Color you have used. This is because the [Material Design System](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/how-the-system-works) does not allow any color to be used as the primary color. If you need 100% compliance, check the **Exact Colors** checkbox:

![Exact Colors Checkbox](../colors-media/checkbox.png)

Now, you can go and test your theme. You can leave the Admin Page and try creating a DMP. If you are happy with your theme, you can return to the Admin Page and click **Save**.

## Advanced Flow

The [Material Design System](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/how-the-system-works) allows for three input colors: primary, secondary and tertiary. The TU Wien theme was actually generated using both a Primary Color `#006699` and a Tertiary Color `#373737`. To input this additional color, you can enable the **Tertiary Color Picker**.

![Tertiary Color Picker](../colors-media/tertiary.png)

For even more color pickers (which have a subtle effect on the application), you can enable the **Advanced** checkbox:

Again, make sure to save your theme if you are happy with it.
