# DAMAP configuration overview

This section contains all supported configuration options for the DAMAP backend. All sections provide options as environment variables you can use when deploying the stock DAMAP backend, but also the [`application.yaml`](https://github.com/damap-org/damap-backend/blob/next/src/main/resources/application.yaml) variant in case you decide to recompile DAMAP from source.

The following configuration sections are available:

- [General](general.md)
- [Authentication](authentication.md)
- [Database](database.md)
